				<h1>The Problem</h1>

				<p>The company was building a recognizable brand that resonated quality and trust, but it had trouble building brand awareness.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>Some users did not know the company's name.</li>
					<li>There was little consistency between products, documentation, training, marketing, and the website.</li>
					<li>The company had defined colors and fonts, but few people knew what they were. Those who did tended to approximate solutions because they did not know the exact value to use or where to find out.</li>
					<li>Some products had multiple logos, and some products didn't have a logo.</li>
					<li>Employees often sent unofficial documentation to customers with no branding. Branded documents frequently suffered from simple problems like blurry logos.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These surface issues betrayed the well-built products the company delivered and frustrated efforts to create a recognizable brand. The company had experimented with style guides in the past, but employees typically ignored them or found them an imposition.</p>

				<h1>The Solution</h1>

				<p>I knew I could not try to sell a list of rules. My first goal was to get buy-in from key departments. I met with the Instructional Designer and Marketing Lead. They were in favor of standardization, and the three of us were responsible for a large portion of the company's digital and print output. We spent several sessions in a room, combing through the company's various, competing design conventions.</p>

		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col s12 m6">

				<h2>Colors</h2>
				<p>We settled on a color palette based on work one of the product design teams had recently completed while redesigning the company's flagship product. We briefly considered alternatives, but changing their product's colors during the late stages of development was prohibitive, and the team's choices were appealing.</p>

				<p>Colors are divided into two groups: the three primary colors with their respective hover and active states, and 17 secondary colors for smaller-scale roles like designing meaningful icons and adding a touch of flare.</p>

				<p>To stop the issue of employees approximating colors, we defined all colors using explicit hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL values.</p>

				<h2>Logos</h2>

				<p>The company's logos suffered from numerous issues.</p>
					
				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>Colors were inconsistent.</li>
					<li>Vector some source files for some logos had been lost or rasterized.</li>
					<li>Some products had multiple logos.</li>
					<li>Some products had no logo.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In consultation with product managers and executives, we defined a single logo for each product.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>I redrew each logo in Adobe Illustrator, matching the newly-defined color palettes, and exporting a variety of vector and raster files that employees would be able to use without effort.</li>
					<li>I formalized a set of rules about how and where each logo should be used, according to previous conventions and the executive team's preference for how each brand and sub-brand should be positioned.</li>

				<h2>Design Language</h2>
				<p>The company's main product design team had established a design language rooted in Microsoft's design language. A design system was outside my mandate, but we felt it important to extend the visual language outside product design. I captured basic principles from the design language to help inform marketing and sales material.</p>

			<div class="col s12 m6">
				<h2>Language and Tone</h2>
				<p>Different departments had historically produced wildly different language. The Documentation and Training teams had spent some time moving their own content to more conversational language, so it was a good opportunity to formalize this change and standardize the company's voice in its various contexts. We defined three distinct voices: technical information, training, and marketing. The tone for each information type was positioned using the Nielsen Norman group's <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/">Four Dimensions of Tone</a>, which helped us capture the essence of the voice the company had already embraced.</p>

		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col s12 m6">
				<h2>Typography</h2>
				<p>This was the easiest portion of the project, as the company had well-established traditions for font use. We formalized the existing rules with minimal discussion, and I provided links to external resources to help employees without design backgrounds choose proper type, size, and spacing.</p>

				<h2>The Final Step: Implementation</h2>
				
				<p>Employees needed to feel that standardization benefited them, not that it was red tape we imposed on them.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>Information needed to be in a single place that was easily accessible and maintainable.</li>
					<li>Guidelines needed support from actual sample files and templates that could form the basis for their deliverables.</li>
					<li>The solution needed to feel authoritative, reflecting that the CEO had been involved.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I created a Brand Resource Center on the company website, targeting internal staff only. By using the company website and CMS, it took on an authoritative feel, and could be easily maintained by the marketing team. The new site was divided into a number of sections that outlined guidelines for proper design. These guidelines included downloads of logos and template files, encouraging employees to go to the Brand Resource Center to get starter files any time they had to create a new deliverable.</p>
