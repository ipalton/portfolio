				<h1>The problem</h1>

				<p>The company had a reputation as a strong audit solution. Despite having strong risk management and compliance solutions, the market generally did not recognize us as the comprehensive governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solution we were.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>We would rebrand our SaaS GRC platform.</li>
					<li>We would sell different "flavors" of that platform that were fundamentally similar, but had language and tools tailored to the needs of our different user communities: audit, controls, compliance, risk management, fraud detection, etc.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To support these changes, we needed to reinvent how we provided help content to our users.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>Our existing GRC platform was documented as a series of disparate help sites, not as a single platform. Users often weren't sure which app solved the problem they had, nor which help site had the answers to their questions. Search was minimally helpful because it was not federated.</li>
					<li>We had insufficient usage data, making it difficult to identify exactly where people struggled with our content.</li>
					<li>We did not have enough technical writers to produce or maintain the volume of content we needed to support all these new user types and personas.</li>
					<li>Like the platform, our support content had to be localized into six languages.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>The solution</h1>

				<p>The team had just completed a major technology modernization. This left us with minimal technical debt, but we had yet to unlock the full potential of our tool set. By putting our existing tools to work in a more effective and mature way, we accommodated the coming product changes while solving many of our most pressing documentation UX issues.</p>

				<h2>Improved top-level content design with high-resolution analytics</h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col l6">
				<p>A solution for telemetry data collection was already in place, but few interactions were actually tracked. The first step was to unlock latent value in that analytics tool by implementing high-resolution reporting for every event and interaction. At the same time, the product team was working to better instrument the platform itself.</p>

				<p>Using these two data solutions, we developed more detailed insight into how our platform and content were used. By recreating user sessions with our content, I examined where things went wrong. Common problems I observed:</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>Search queries returned irrelevant results.</li>
					<li>Users moved from one site to another, looking for the same things.</li>
					<li>Pages had misleading titles or headings.</li>
					<li>Direct feedback submissions that a piece of content wasn't helpful because it wasn't what the user was looking for.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This data codified many of the issues we already suspected. The different components of our platform were tightly connected, and users moved between them with some regularity. It was not surprising that the information around those components was consumed in a similar way. However, our users simply didn't know which help site to go to, especially when trying to execute complex tasks that involved multiple modules. We needed to combine our module-based sites into one platform site with a clear, goal-oriented information architecture.</p>

				<p>The data also set helpful baselines for what would become our KPIs. We were able to measure how effectively our users found and engaged with content. We then monitored changes to those KPIs as we made investments over time.</p>

				<h2>Getting the right content to the right people by single sourcing</h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col l6">

				<p>We had merged all of our content into a single content pool, but it wasn't enough to give everyone an identical experience.</p>

				<p>To broaden the user base of our platform, we had to appeal to different types of users more directly. This meant selling them only those parts of the platform that were most relevant to their objectives, and using language and terminology that resonated with them.</p>

				<p>The implications on content were substantial. Depending on the product package they purchased, our customers would see substantially different terminology and different sets of tools and modules. To properly support these flavors of the platform, we also needed different flavors of help content that reflected what users saw and wanted to do in the product. This meant increasing our overall content delivery 600%.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col l6">

				<p> The team was not large enough to accommodate that kind of growth. Even if it had been, the fundamental building blocks of the platform were always the same. It didn't make sense to write similar content multiple times.</p>

				<p>Instead, we implemented variables and content conditions. We were able to maintain a single content base as we always had, but use that base to build multiple similar but distinct outputs. Those who bought the audit flavor of the platform saw audit-related terminology and guidance in the documentation, while those who bought the risk management flavor saw risk terminology and guidance.</p>

				<p>Through disciplined use of single-sourcing, we increased the volume and diversity of the content we delivered with only minimal growth in upkeep. Most importantly, our users only had to worry about one documentation site that was an exact match for the product they used.</p>

				<h2>Localization</h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col l6">
				<p>We had a well-established localization process for our content, but that process would not accommodate variables and conditional content. We worked with the localization team in advance to ensure they could accommodate our vision.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>We adjusted the localization process. Instead of localizing from the source content, it would localize from the output, after variables and conditions had been accounted for.</li>
					<li>Thanks to translation memory, most of our existing translations could be reused with small modifications.</li>
					<li>Because we were standardizing terminology between the product and the documentaton, the l10n team was able to build a consistent translation style guide and controlled terminology, which they applied to all aspects of the platform, the documentation, and other content.</li>
					<li>We were able to detect a number of bugs in our help authoring tool and translation management system. We worked with our vendors to identify the deficiencies and recommend solutions, which they implemented.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>As a result of our collaboration and early planning, we were able to go to market with translations live for our most critical solutions. Lower-priority translations were merged in shortly after.</p>

				<h2>What Didn't Go Well</h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col">

				<p>Few projects go perfectly, and this one was no exception.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">

					<li>Since we had switched from localizing source content to output content, ongoing translation costs grew. Similar content had to be localized several times because each instance was slightly different. This increased the amount of translation we needed, and the amount of time the l10n time spent sending and merging new batches of translations.</li>

					<li>There were problems with the way the company divided and sold the platform. People regularly wanted capabilities from multiple flavors. Our product and sale model limited our options for up-selling to multiple solutions.</li>

					<li>Consistent with what we saw in the platform itself, documentation users often searched for content pertaining to capabilities that weren't available in their flavor. We began including content for features they didn't have, to make it clear the capabilities they wanted existed but they couldn't use them. Over time, our various help sites became nearly identical in scope and structure. This served our users well, but questioned the true value of our single-sourcing model.</li>

				<h1>Outcome and Legacy</h1>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row container">
			<div class="col">
				<p>This project had some important takeaways.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>We increased time on page 13.8% and decreased pages viewed per session 25%. This was an important KPI that signaled users who were finding what they needed easily, and then engaging with it.</li>
					<li>Searches per session were down 21% while the search result click-through rate was up 23%. This suggested a marked improvement in the search experience.</li>
					<li>When asked "Was this helpful?", 63% of our readers responded "Yes".</li>
					<li>Our team's work was regarded as an important part of the platform. A number of our customers expressed gratitude for the strength of our documentation. One of our regional user groups disbanded, citing the quality of our docs as a key motivator. They simply didn't need each others' support anymore.</li>
					<li>MadCap, one of our vendors, considered our solution innovative enough to <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/case-study/galvanize-uses-madcap-flare/">publish a case study</a> about us.</li>
					<li>We were purchased for one billion dollars, largely on the strength of our GRC platform.</li>
