				<p>Please note that, due to a non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to provide real screenshots or specific information about some elements of this project.</p>
				
				<h1>The Problem</h1>

				<p>The company was unable to communicate outages and maintenance to its customers.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>General communications depended on a CRM containing unreliable contact data. This made it difficult to reach the right audiences.</li>
					<li>Targeted communications like push notifications required multiple writers, developers, and managers to complete a sequence of complex processes. This made it impossible to communicate with users quickly.</li>
					<li>Communications systems were typically tied to other internal systems, so outages took communications offline, too.</li>
					<li>The organization favored a strategy that avoided acknowledging service issues. It was concerned that communicating negative information would impact its image as a reliable, upscale solution.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The end result was a spike in support calls during outages, customers who couldn't work, and frustration that there was no information about what was happening. Following an internal audit of the company's readiness for crisis management, the executive team asked me to take control of the company's external communications.</p>

				<h1>The Solution</h1>

				<p>While visiting London, I took notice of Transport for London's Status Updates. Travelers had a number of opportunities to learn of travel disruptions using the system of their choice. The TFL website, Twitter, email alerts, and even third-party routing tools like Google Maps informed commuters of disruptions as they happened. The robustness of this system left an impression on me.</p>

				<h2>Requirements</h2>

				<p>I reviewed the deficiencies identified in the internal audit and spoke at length with relevant stakeholders, including the customer support team, IT, and other managers. I determined several requirements that would allow the company to communicate freely.</p>

				<ol class="browser-defaults">
					<li><strong>Always Up</strong>. No matter what was down, communications had to be up.</li>
					<li><strong>Effective</strong>. Communications had to reach the right people in the right contexts; we could not show irrelevant information to the wrong audience or put information places people wouldn't see it.</li>
					<li><strong>Fast</strong>. We had to measure our response time in seconds or minutes, not hours or days.</li>
					<li><strong>Easy</strong>. The process had to be so simple that one non-technical employee could coordinate communications.</li>
					<li><strong>Single-Source</strong>. We needed one source of status information that could easily broadcast to any format or outlet.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Vendor Choice</h2>

				<p>I rejected a home-grown solution. Creating a new system from scratch would have required significant upfront investments and technical resources for future maintenance, and external services were more likely to remain online during an outage. After research, I settled on a third-party system status service as the basis for our new communications network.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>It operated on a globally-distributed network and guaranteed uptime.</li>
					<li>It had a simple web interface. Anyone could rapidly send communications from any location and device.</li>
					<li>It had a robust API and built-in integrations, meaning we could integrate the system into the organization's email, social media, CRM, websites, and applications as we deemed it effective.</li>
					<li>It could be automated, so communicators did not have to be on standby after-hours.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Implementation</h2>

				<p>I implemented the API into the public website and support documentation myself, and created detailed specifications for our engineers so they could integrate the API into our existing products. I focused on an implementation that was contextually-sensitive, so outage information would only be seen in circumstances where it was appropriate or beneficial to the user in that moment.</p>

				<p>The result was a tremendous improvement in our ability to communicate during outages and a reduction in support calls during outages.</p>

				<h1>Outcome and Legacy</h1>

				<p>The system has had a number of successes, both technologically and culturally.</p>

				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>It reduced time-to-notification during outages by about 95%.</li>
					<li>It ended the organization's tendency to enter "panic" mode during outages and helped clarify responsibilities in these situations.</li>
					<li>It reduced customer calls during outages and improved customer satisfaction. Customers are pleased when they discover they can look up status information, and express gratitude for our transparency in an industry that is notoriously secretive.</li>
					<li>It improved the culture of communication within the organization. After the system's first use, it received universal praise for its simplicity and effectiveness.</li>
